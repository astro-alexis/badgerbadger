# badgerbadger
Badge generator for events (such as conferences)

badgerbadger is a simple script that generates conference badge
from a template. The script takes 3 arguments: first name, last
name, institute.

How to execute the script:
bash badgerbadger.sh "firstname" "lastname" "institute"

Inkscape is used via command line in the final step to convert
badges from svg to pdf format.
